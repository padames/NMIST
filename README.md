Convolutional neural network on the famous NMIST handwritten digit dataset

[NMIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a web page to download the data, read about technical details, and see the benchmarks of top error rate record setting algorithms.

To see the notebook with the first slightly overfitted convolutional neural network on the MNIST data set point your browser to [NMIST predictions with Keras and Tensorflow in R](https://padames.github.io/NMIST/NMIST.html)
